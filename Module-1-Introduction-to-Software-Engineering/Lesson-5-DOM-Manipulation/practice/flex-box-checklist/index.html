    <p> My name is Sharon Bacchus. I am born and raised in New York. My nationality is Guyanese. I am a single mother with a 19 year old daughter named Amber that is attending Adelphi University. I currently reside in New Hyde Park, New York. 
        I have over 20 years of experience in Banking Finance. I recently completed an online program at Harvard University and received a certificate for Cybersecurity in Risk Management in January 2024. My goal is to complete this program and utilize my knowledge and career experience and elevate my life with a new job that will utilize my experiences and be a valuable asset to a growing business. 
        My special interests include staycations, beach days, traveling, snowtubing, snowboarding and binge watching Hallmark Christmas movies.
        My future goal is to obtain some real estate investment properties.
