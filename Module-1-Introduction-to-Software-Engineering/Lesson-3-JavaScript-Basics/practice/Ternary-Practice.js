// USE FAKE INFO FOR THE FOLLOWING EXERCISE

// Initialize a variable called creditCardNum, set it equal to a fake credit card string-number
let creditCardNum = "4444-1111-5555-6666"

// Initialize a variable called last4SS, set it equal to a 4 string-numbers (don't use your real SS last 4!)
let last4SS = '6789'

// Initialize a variable called userId, set it equal to a fake user ID
let user = 'userID21'


// Initialize a variable called password, set it equal to a fake password
let password = 'Thisisfake21'

// Create two last variables called inputId & inputPass, initially set them as the same values as userId and password
let inputID = 'userID21'
let inputPass = 'Thisisfake21'


// Write a ternary statement that checks if userId is equal to inputId and if password is also equal to inputPass
// If they are the same, log the credit card num and the last4SS
// If not, log 'incorrect username or id'
let text = user === inputID && inputPass === password ? "creditCardNum" : "incorrect user or inputid" 
    console.log(text)
